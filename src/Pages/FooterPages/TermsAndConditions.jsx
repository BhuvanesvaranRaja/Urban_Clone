        <h4 className="mt-4 fw-bolder fs-4 mb-3">Cookies</h4>
        <p>
          We employ the use of cookies.I have just updated to the latest Ang
          15.1.3 and the TS too but it's still the same sluggish response and
          sometimes pressing F12 doesn't even take back you to the source
          variable/method. I understand that these are not treated as issues by
          you guys but what I really don't understand is, these features
          (intellisense/f12, suggestions) were super fast in the earlier
          versions and even the suggestions like switch command, settimeouts,
          etc were coming in milliseconds and now they are taking at least 5
          secs or they even don't show up, so how do you guys prioritize this,
          as a low-level issue, if it is then the Ang or TS frontend devs would
          be frustrated... By accessing U-Company, you agreed to use cookies in
          agreement with U-Company's Privacy Policy.
